# TDM-VAL-Scenario-Comparison-Toolbox

This repository contains some helpful scripts to assist in validating and viewing TDM outputs, before the v9.1.0 release. Some of the content includes:

 - sending data to big query
 - app prep for the total tdm tool (tool used before the use of the vizTool)
 - various jupyter notebooks for comparing segment information, transit comparisons, transit maps, etc.
